# INSP3T0R

#### Description
Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/`
#### Hints: 

> How do you inspect web code on a browser? 
> There's 3 parts
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on this name, we immediately think of using **INSPECT**, let check the HTML code and we will get a part of the flag, do again with CSS and JavaScript then we will get all of it. But if you want to find automatically, ***BURPSUITE*** helps you to do, let's go.  
## **STEP**	

 **1**. Open Burp, on the Target tab<br>
 **2**. Right click on this web, click **Engagement tools** > **Find comments** > Get the flag
